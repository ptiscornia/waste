### Analyzable
• Dataset is in a rectangular (rows and columns), machine-readable format. Variable names are the first row only. The remaining data should be made up of values in cells.
• One or more columns uniquely identify rows in the data (i.e., primary key).
• All column values are explicit.
• No values are indicated by color coding.
• All non-missing values are explicitly defined (e.g., if a blank is assumed to be 0, it is filled with a 0).
• Only one piece of information is contained in a variable.

### Complete
• Everyone in your sample (e.g., consented, included in study, completed the instrument) is accounted for.
• If you collected it, it should exist in the file.
• There should be no rows with duplicate primary keys (e.g., study unique identifiers).
• Interpretable
• Variable names are machine (i.e., no special characters or spaces) AND human-readable (consistently formatted and clear to humans).
• Variable and value labels are added if sharing in SPSS, Stata, SAS format.
• Consider sharing in at least one non-proprietary format (e.g., CSV).

### Valid
• Variables conform to the constraints that you have laid out in your data dictionary
• Planned variable types (e.g., numeric, character, date).
• Allowable variable values and ranges (e.g., 1-50).
• Item-level missingness aligns with variable universe and skip patterns.

### Accurate
• There are no glaring errors in the data that you have not acknowledged.
• Based on any implicit knowledge you have.
• Based on a comparison of information within and across sources.

### Consistent
• Variable values are consistently measured, formatted, or categorized within a column.
• Variables are consistently measured across collections of the same form.

### De-identified
• Disclosure risks have been addressed (both direct and indirect identifiers have been removed/altered as needed).
